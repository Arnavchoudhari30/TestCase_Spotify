The testing process for Spotify was carried out by validating two critical modules: Login and Search functionalities. The Login module was tested thoroughly to ensure smooth and secure user authentication. Various scenarios were validated, such as logging in with valid credentials, invalid credentials, and leaving the fields blank. The application correctly allowed access only for valid users and displayed appropriate error messages when incorrect or incomplete input was provided. Additionally, social login functionality was verified using the “Continue with Google” option, which successfully redirected the user to the Spotify homepage after successful authentication via the Google account. The password recovery flow was also tested by initiating the "Forgot Password" option, where the system correctly triggered a reset link to the registered email address.

Moving on to the Search module, several test scenarios were covered to ensure users could find music effectively. A successful search for a valid song title, like “Shape of You,” displayed accurate and relevant results. Negative test cases, such as searching with special characters or performing a search without entering any text, were handled gracefully by the application—either by showing “No results found” or by remaining idle with no unintended behavior. The search autocomplete (suggestion) feature was also validated, and it showed predictive results as expected when typing partial keywords. Lastly, the application's response to network loss during a search was tested; the app displayed a proper “You’re offline” or “No internet connection” message, indicating good handling of connectivity issues.

All the test cases passed successfully, confirming that both modules function correctly and offer a robust user experience.
